<h2><strong>Survey on Effective Government Copywriting</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Hello! We're a team from <a href="open.gov.sg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Open Government Products</a> exploring
how Large Language Models (LLMs) can help improve Government website copy
(in simple speak: the texts you see on Government websites).

Option A") may be published. By submitting this form, you consent to us
using your responses in this way.</p>
