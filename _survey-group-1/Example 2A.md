<h3>National Childhood Immunisation Schedule</h3>
<p>The National Childhood Immunisation Schedule (NCIS) comprises childhood
vaccinations recommended as the standard of care for protection against
vaccine preventable diseases that are of significant healthcare burden
to Singapore or would be so without these vaccinations.</p>
<p>In consultation with the Expert Committee on Immunisation (ECI), MOH regularly
reviews vaccination policies and inclusion of vaccines into the schedule,
taking into consideration local disease burden, vaccine safety, efficacy
and cost effectiveness of the vaccines. This ensures that the national
recommendations for childhood vaccination are up to date.</p>
<p>The NCIS covers vaccinations against 14 diseases - tuberculosis, hepatitis
B, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliovirus, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type
b, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella (chickenpox), pneumococcal disease,
human papillomavirus and influenza.</p>
<p>Of these, vaccinations against measles and diphtheria are compulsory for
children under the Infectious Diseases Act.</p>
<h3>National Adult Immunisation Schedule</h3>
<p>The National Adult Immunisation Schedule (NAIS) was established in November
2017 to provide guidance on vaccinations that persons age 18 years or older
should adopt to protect themselves against vaccine-preventable diseases.</p>
<p>Certain adults are at increased risk of complications or susceptible to
vaccine preventable diseases if they have not previously received the vaccination
and are in contact with individuals who have the infection. Vaccinations
recommended under the NAIS aim to prevent such infections among susceptible
individuals and reduce complications, morbidity and mortality.</p>
<p>The NAIS was developed based on international best practice and the recommendations
of the Expert Committee on Immunisation (ECI). Considerations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>local disease burden;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>age, occupation, pre-existing medical conditions, vaccination history;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>vaccine safety, efficacy and cost effectiveness of the vaccines in preventing
infections among susceptible individuals and reducing complications, morbidity
and mortality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The vaccines in the NAIS protect against the following 11 diseases â€“ Influenza,
pneumococcal disease, human papillomavirus, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis,
measles, mumps, hepatitis B, and varicella (chickenpox).</p>
