<p>To start your journey of selling your flat, you will need to register
an <strong>Intent to Sell</strong> by logging in to <strong>My Flat Dashboard</strong> using
your Singpass.</p>
<h3>Purpose of registering an Intent to Sell</h3>
<p>The Intent to Sell allows you to check your eligibility to sell your flat.
Upon registering an Intent to Sell, you will be informed of when you may
start to grant an Option to Purchase (OTP) to potential flat buyers, which
must be at least 7 days after registering the Intent to Sell.</p>
<p>You will be prompted to download a copy of the OTP and compute your estimated
net proceeds as well as receive information about Ethnic Integration Policy
(EIP) and Singapore Permanent Resident (SPR) Quota for your block, status
of upgrading, billing of upgrading costs, and recent transacted prices
of nearby flats. You will also be reminded to plan your next housing. There
is no fee payable for registering an Intent to Sell.</p>
<p>Your Intent to Sell is valid for 12 months. It must be valid when you
grant the OTP to the buyer(s) and when you submit the resale application.</p>
<h3>Sellers to register an Intent to Sell</h3>
<p>You must register an Intent to Sell personally, regardless of whether
you have engaged a salesperson. If there is more than one owner for your
flat, only one of you need to register on behalf of all the flat owners.</p>
<p>If there are any personal matters that may affect the flat ownership,
such as divorce or estate issues, it is advisable that you settle these
matters before you register the Intent to Sell.</p>
<p><strong>Important notes:</strong>

<li>
<p>The results generated from the Intent to Sell are based on information
you have provided. It is only an indication of your eligibility and does
not constitute an approval by HDB to sell your flat. This will be determined
after we receive your resale application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must provide accurate information when you register an Intent to Sell
and cannot change the information provided throughout your flat selling
journey. If you need to make changes, you have to cancel your Intent to
Sell and register a new one. Otherwise, you will not be able to proceed
to the subsequent steps and your resale application may be rejected.
