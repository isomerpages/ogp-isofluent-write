<p>While our air quality is relatively good as compared to major cities,
pollutants such as particulate matter and ozone remain a concern.</p>
<p>PM2.5 and PM10 refer to air particles that measure less than 2.5 and 10
micrometres in diameter respectively. These air particles are often found
in dirt, dust and soot, and are dangerous to health because they can lodge
deep in our lungs.</p>
<h3>The challenge - Modern life affects air quality</h3>
<p>Many of our activities can result in air pollution. Our main local sources
of air pollution are vehicles, power stations and other industries.</p>
<p>A comprehensive approach is in place to ensure that Singapore maintains
good air quality. In the planning stage, pollutive industries are deliberately
sited away from residential areas, and factories are required to meet strict
emission standards in their design and during operations.</p>
<p>Key sources of emissions must adhere to prevailing regulations. For example,
all motor vehicles are subject to fuel quality standards and exhaust emission
standards for both new and in-use vehicles.</p>
