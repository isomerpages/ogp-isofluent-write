<h2><strong>Intent to Sell</strong></h2>
<p>To begin selling your flat, log in to My Flat Dashboard using your Singpass
and register your Intent to Sell.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Purpose of Registering an Intent to Sell</h3>
<p>Registering an Intent to Sell lets you check your eligibility to sell
your flat. After registering, you’ll find out when you can start granting
an Option to Purchase (OTP) to potential buyers. The OTP can only be granted
at least 7 days after registering the Intent to Sell.</p>
<p>You’ll be prompted to download a copy of the OTP, calculate your estimated
net proceeds, and access details about the Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP),
the Singapore Permanent Resident (SPR) Quota for your block, upgrading
status, billing for upgrading costs, and recent transaction prices of nearby
flats. You’ll also be reminded to plan for your next home. There is no
fee for registering your Intent to Sell.</p>
<p>Your Intent to Sell is valid for 12 months. It must remain valid when
you grant the OTP to the buyer(s) and when you submit your resale application.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Who Needs to Register an Intent to Sell</h3>
<p>You must personally register your Intent to Sell, even if you’ve hired
a salesperson. If multiple owners share the flat, only one person needs
to register on behalf of all owners.</p>
<p>If there are any personal matters, such as divorce or estate issues, that
may affect flat ownership, it’s best to resolve them before registering
your Intent to Sell.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Important Notes</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The results from the Intent to Sell are based on the information you provide.
It indicates your eligibility but does not approve your flat sale. Approval
will be determined after we receive your resale application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide accurate information when registering your Intent to Sell. You
cannot change this information later. If you need to make changes, you
must cancel your current Intent to Sell and register a new one. If you
don’t, you won’t be able to proceed with the next steps, and your resale
application may be rejected.</p>
</li>
</ul>
