<h3>Training Cycle</h3>
<p>Over your Operationally Ready National Service (ORNS) training cycle,
you will receive call-ups for various ORNS activities. To complete an ORNS
year, you need to participate in an ORNS activity within your work-year,
which starts on 1 April and ends on 31 March of the following year.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Call-up limit</h3>
<p>You may be called up for not more than 40 calendar days of ORNS activities
per work year (Apr to Mar). If you have been called up beyond 40-days in
a work-year, you are required to consult and seek your employer (if any)'s
agreement for this extended service. You will then have to sign an undertaking
to indicate acceptance of this arrangement.
<br>
</p>
<h3>Call-ups that span across 2 work-years</h3>
<p>When the duration of a call-up falls within 2 work years, e.g. a HK ICT
from 27 March 2017 (5 days in work-year 2016) to 7 April 2017 (7 days in
work-year 2017), this HK ICT is considered to be within work-year 2016.
This training period will be counted as part of the 40-day limit of ORNS
activities per work-year, while work-year 2016 will be counted as an ORNS
year.</p>
