<h3>National Childhood Immunisation Schedule</h3>
<p>The National Childhood Immunisation Schedule (NCIS) lists childhood vaccines
that are recommended to protect against diseases that significantly impact
healthcare in Singapore. These vaccines prevent diseases that would pose
a major health threat if not addressed.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health (MOH), in consultation with the Expert Committee
on Immunisation (ECI), regularly updates the vaccination policy, reviewing
factors like local disease burden, vaccine safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness.
This ensures that childhood vaccination recommendations remain current.</p>
<p>The NCIS covers vaccines for 14 diseases: tuberculosis, hepatitis B, diphtheria,
tetanus, pertussis, poliovirus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, measles,
mumps, rubella, varicella (chickenpox), pneumococcal disease, human papillomavirus,
and influenza.</p>
<p>Vaccinations against measles and diphtheria are mandatory for children
under the Infectious Diseases Act.

<h3>National Adult Immunisation Schedule</h3>
<p>The National Adult Immunisation Schedule (NAIS), introduced in November
2017, recommends vaccines for individuals aged 18 and older to protect
against preventable diseases.</p>
<p>Certain adults may be more at risk of complications if they havenâ€™t received
specific vaccinations or are exposed to infections. The NAIS aims to protect
at-risk individuals, reducing complications and improving overall health.</p>
<p>The NAIS follows international best practices and the ECI's recommendations,
considering factors such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Local disease burden</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Age, occupation, pre-existing health conditions, and vaccination history</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vaccine safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness in preventing infections
and reducing complications</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The NAIS includes vaccines for 11 diseases: influenza, pneumococcal disease,
human papillomavirus, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, measles, mumps, hepatitis
B, and varicella (chickenpox).
