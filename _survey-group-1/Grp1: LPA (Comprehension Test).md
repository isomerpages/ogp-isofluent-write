<h2><strong>What Is A Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA)</strong></h2>
<p>The LPA is a legal document and a deed, which allows a person who is at
least 21 years of age ('Donor'), to voluntarily appoint one or more persons
('Donee(s)')&nbsp;to make decisions and act on his/her behalf&nbsp;if he/she&nbsp;loses
mental capacity one day. A Donee&nbsp;can be appointed to act in the&nbsp;two
broad areas of&nbsp;personal welfare&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;property &amp; affairs&nbsp;matters.
The LPA also gives the authority to the Donee to sign deeds on the Donor's
behalf.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of deeds include:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>An instrument used to appoint another individual to act on your behalf</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An instrument used to transfer an interest in immovable property (in the
case of an LPA, Donee(s) may be able to do so on behalf of the Donor if
they are granted property &amp; affairs powers as defined in the LPA)â€¨</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Benefits of an LPA</h3>
<p>Enables&nbsp;a person to&nbsp;make a personal, considered choice&nbsp;of
a trusted proxy decision maker, who is reliable and competent to act in
his/her best interests should he/she lose mental capacity one day.</p>
<p>Alleviates the stress and difficulties faced by loved ones who need to
apply for a Deputyship order, if the person loses mental capacity without
an LPA in place.</p>
<p>You are also encouraged to make an Advance Care Plan (ACP), and appoint
your Donee as your Nominated Healthcare Spokesperson. Visit the&nbsp;ACP
website&nbsp;for more information.</p>
