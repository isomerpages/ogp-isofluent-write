<p>Good air quality is essential for protecting public health and improving
our quality of life.</p>
<p>Singaporeâ€™s air quality is generally better than that of many major cities,
but pollutants like particulate matter (PM) and ozone remain concerns.</p>
<p>PM2.5 and PM10 are tiny air particles less than 2.5 and 10 micrometres
in diameter. These particles, often found in dirt, dust, and soot, can
lodge deep in your lungs, posing serious health risks.</p>
<h3>How modern life impacts air quality</h3>
<p>Everyday activities contribute to air pollution. In Singapore, vehicles,
power stations, and industries are the main sources.</p>
<p>We take a comprehensive approach to maintain good air quality:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Pollutive industries are planned away from residential areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Factories must meet strict emission standards in both design and operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vehicles must comply with fuel quality and exhaust emission standards,
whether new or in use.</p>
</li>
</ul>
