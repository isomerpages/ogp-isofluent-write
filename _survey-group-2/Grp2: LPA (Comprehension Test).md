<p>An LPA is a legal document that allows anyone aged 21 or older (the "Donor")
to appoint one or more trusted individuals (the "Donee(s)") to make decisions
and act on their behalf if they lose mental capacity. Donee(s) can be authorised
to handle two main areas: personal welfare and/or property &amp; affairs
matters. The LPA also gives Donee(s) the authority to sign deeds on the
Donorâ€™s behalf.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of deeds include:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Documents appointing someone to act on your behalf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instruments for transferring an interest in immovable property (if the
Donee is granted property &amp; affairs powers in the LPA).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Benefits of an LPA</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Personal Choice: You can choose a trusted person to make decisions in
your best interests if you lose mental capacity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduces Stress: Avoids the difficulties your loved ones would face applying
for a Deputyship order if no LPA is in place.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You are encouraged to make an Advance Care Plan (ACP) and appoint your
Donee as your Nominated Healthcare Spokesperson. Visit the ACP website
for more information.</p>
