<h3>Training Cycle</h3>
<p>During your Operationally Ready National Service (ORNS) training cycle,
you will receive call-ups for various ORNS activities. To complete an ORNS
year, you must participate in at least one ORNS activity within your work
year, which runs from 1 April to 31 March of the following year.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Call-up limit</h3>
<p>You can be called up for a maximum of 40 calendar days of ORNS activities
per work year (April to March). If you are called up for more than 40 days
in a work year, you must seek your employerâ€™s agreement (if any) for the
extended service. You will also need to sign an undertaking to confirm
acceptance of this arrangement.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Call-Ups Spanning Two Work Years</h3>
<p>If a call-up extends across two work years (e.g., HK ICT from 27 March
2017 to 7 April 2017), the entire activity is considered part of the earlier
work year (in this example, work year 2016). The full duration of the training
will count toward the 40-day limit for work year, and work year 2016 will
also count as an ORNS year.</p>
